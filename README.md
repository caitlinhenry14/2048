# 2048
The 2048 game we all know and love, made for Mac/iOS in Swift. The visuals were inspired by [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/visual-studio-code), one of my favorite VS Code themes. 

To play, clone the repo into Xcode and run a simulation of the game. It's worth noting that while the game is fully playable right now, it's still in progress, and I have a couple minor issues to solve (namely that nothing really happens once you lose).

## To-Do List
Some things that I may or may not ever get around to
- Add WASD controls in addition to arrows (I broke my left arrow key...)
- Generate 4s in addition to 2s
- Display score
